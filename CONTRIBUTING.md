## Prerequisites for running and testing code

These are one time installations required to be able to test your changes locally as part of the pull request (PR) submission process.

1. install Go [through download](https://go.dev/doc/install) | [through Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go)
1. [install golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation)

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Configure and install the dependencies: `go mod tidy`
1. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `go test -v ./...`
1. Make sure linter passes on your machine: `golangci-lint run`
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests and linter still pass
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
1. Please be patient while waiting for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
